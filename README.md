# Task 12 – Power BI Data Transformation using Power Query

## Objective
The goal of this task is to learn how to clean, transform, and prepare raw data using Power BI Power Query before creating dashboards.

## Dataset Used
Sample Superstore Dataset (CSV)

---

## Tools Used

## Data Cleaning Steps Performed

I imported the dataset into Power BI and opened Power Query Editor.  
Then I performed the following transformations:

- Removed unwanted columns (Row ID, Postal Code)
- Renamed columns clearly
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing/null values
- Changed correct data types (Date, Decimal, Whole number)
- Split Order Date into Year and Month
- Merged City and State into Location column
- Created conditional columns:
  - Profit Status (Profit / Loss)
  - Sales Band (Low / Medium / High)

## Visualizations Created

- Sales by Region (Bar Chart)
- Profit by Category (Column Chart)
- Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)

These visuals help understand sales performance and profit trends.

## Outcome

Through this task, I learned:
- Data cleaning using Power Query
- Handling null values
